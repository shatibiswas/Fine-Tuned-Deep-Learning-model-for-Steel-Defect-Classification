# Fine-Tuned-Deep-Learning-model-for-Steel-Defect-Classification
Developed an automated steel surface defect detection system using deep learning on the NEU dataset (1,800 images). Improved baseline CNN accuracy (42%) to ~99% via transfer learning, fine-tuned ResNet50V2, and augmentation, enabling robust, real-time quality control in manufacturing.
